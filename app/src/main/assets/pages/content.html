        Therefore, the need for an application which is exhaustive, comprehensive, and lucid has been

        examinations. Our Endeavour is to enable and equip the aspirants with the essential knowledge
        required for the preparation of judicial exams. We have made sincere efforts to make the present
        work much more informative and useful.</p>
